# My journey Through the internet on Git and Github

---

### Definitions and concepts I found :

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- It has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
- One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching capabilities. 
- Instead of a working copy, each developer gets their own local repository, complete with a full history of commits.
- Git has come to be the expected version control system for new projects. If your team is using Git, odds are you won’t have to train new hires on your workflow, because they’ll already be familiar with distributed development.
